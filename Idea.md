3. **Problem Statement:**  
"Many people struggle to keep track of their spending habits and often overspend without realizing it. Manual methods like paper logs or spreadsheets are time-consuming and lack convenience.

5. **Key Features:**  
- Add, edit, and delete income/expense entries  
- Categorize transactions (Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, etc.)  
- View monthly summaries with charts  
- Budget tracking and spending alerts  
- Dark mode support  
- Local data storage for offline use  

6. **Target Users / Audience:**  
"Individuals who want to manage their personal finances more effectively, including students, working professionals, and small business owners."

7. **Technology Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React Native  
- **Navigation:** React Navigation  
- **Data Storage:** AsyncStorage  
- **Charts:** react-native-chart-kit  
- **State Management:** Context API or Redux (optional)  

8. **Expected Outcome:**  
"A fully functional mobile application where users can input transactions, view spending patterns in charts, and track budgets. All features will work offline using local storage, providing a smooth and responsive user experience."

9. **Timeline:**  
- **Week 1–2:** UI/UX design and component setup  
- **Week 3–4:** Implement transaction management (add/edit/delete) and local storage  
- **Week 5:** Integrate charts and analytics view  
- **Week 6:** Testing, UI polishing, and dark mode implementation  

10. **Additional Notes:**
